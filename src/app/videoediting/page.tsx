            My story with Video Editing
        </CardTitle>
        <CardContent className='p-6 flex gap-7'>
        Iâ€™ve been passionate about video editing since I was about 10 years old, using a heavy laptop that barely ran Premiere Pro. I started with Windows Movie Maker, creating fun presentations for school projects in middle school. As I got better, I moved on to Sony Vegas Pro and then switched to Adobe tools like Premiere Pro and After Effects.
<br/>
        In high school, I edited videos for events organized by school clubs, capturing special moments and telling stories through my edits. My love for cinema and storytelling kept growing, and I eventually started freelancing on Upwork, helping clients create exciting and engaging videos.
<br/>
        Video editing has always been my way of turning ideas into visual stories that people can connect with.
